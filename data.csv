The battery life is amazing...lasts for a few days...looks like an Apple watch...love that I can view emails - calls coming in...very pleased!

"Connects to strava and google fit","I like the watch, and all the features one being able to sync to the two  apps i use *strava and google fit* -which was my selling feature. I also enjoy the *relax* function. Its water proofed enough where washing hands or the dishes wont ruin it. But That's as much watering around ive done with it.  So its not submerged in water... What i don't like is, i seem to break out in extremely itchy bumps where the watch sits on my wrist. Forcing me to remove the watch from a few hrs to a few days depending how bad my reaction is. Bumps appear where the little green light flashes to read your heart rate... So idk.. The battery life is AMAZING Although it came at 97% charged i did charge it to 100% before using, and it's held it's charge for 10 days it still at 50% Overall decent watch for the price. It's no fitbit but serves its purpose.","10 Jan 2021","Color Name: ChristmasBlack","","Yes","Jacqueline","4.0","Lintelek Smart Watch with 1.3"" LCD Full Touch Screen, Large Screen Fitness Tracker with Heart Rate Monitor, Pedometer, Sleep Tracker, Waterproof Activity Tracker for Men, Women and Gift","https://www.amazon.ca/product-reviews/B07XM5PKDV/ref=acr_dp_hist_5?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Half size up :)","I have only run in them a couple of times, but so far they feel great. I normally wear a size 9, and I ordered a 9.5, and Iâ€™m glad I did. There is plenty of room, but not too much. The only thing that will take me getting used to is that they are slightly bulkier than my ASICS.

"Pretty much everything that i was looking for in a large laptop","the box delivered on time and safe.  it was double boxed and packed well. the included laptop bag is good quality and will work well when i need to use it.  i would not buy this laptop for the bag but it is a nice value add. speed and response on this laptop is everything that i was looking for.  set up was easy and came 1/2 charged so i didn't have to immediately plug in. My only concern is battery life.  this is the largest laptop that i have ever had.  i use mainly for school and work.  i don't game or stream a lot of video.  but in the 4 hours that i have had the laptop open today, the battery has already dropped to 25%.  i don't know if that is to be expected with the multiple windows open and the large screen but i don't expect to get 8 hours out of the charge if i am on it.  I will keep the power cable near by.  if you are using less, you might make a full day on a charge.","31 Oct 2019","","","Yes","Gregg Stepp","4.0","2019 HP 15.6 Inch HD Premium Business Laptop PC, Intel Dual-core i3-7100U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, USB 3.1, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, Windows 10, W/ Legendary Computer Backpack & Mouse Pad Bundle","https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Dual-core-Bluetooth-Legendary/product-reviews/B07VMDCLXV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
